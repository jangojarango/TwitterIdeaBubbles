==================

Enter a search term and see how new ideas pop up based on the words retrieved in related tweets.

CAVEATS
==================
currently only works with chrome and the --disable-web-security switch enabled. 
(because right now I make twitter API calls directly - will add a php twitter proxy soon!)

HOW TO INSTALL
==================
just throw it on a webserver with PHP and mention me (Andreas Reiter, @jangojarango), Sebastian Mellor (who did the 'physics') 

any comments are appreciated!

Cheers!
